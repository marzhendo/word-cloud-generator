## üí° How It Works

The application takes the user-provided text from the `<textarea>`. When the "Generate" button is clicked, a JavaScript function processes the text by:
1.  Converting all words to lowercase.
2.  Splitting the text into an array of individual words.
3.  Filtering out common "stop words".
4.  Counting the frequency of each unique word.
5.  Formatting this data into an array of `[word, count]` pairs.

This array is then passed to the **WordCloud2.js** library, along with customization options (like shape and color), which handles the complex task of calculating the layout and drawing the final image onto the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.
